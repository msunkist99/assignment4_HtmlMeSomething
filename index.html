          <h1>Packing Up and Moving to a New Home</h1>
          <article>
              <p>
                  So the time has come to move to a new home.  Packing and moving is very different when you are downsizing to a smaller home instead of moving to a home of the same size as your current
                  home or even when up sizing to a larger home.
              </p>
              <p>Because I recently "downsized" ---- downsize will be the focus of this web page</p>
              <p>My downsizing was defined as - </p>
              <ul>
                  <li>going from a ranch home to a townhome so the basement was much smaller.  And I started with a huge empty basement.</li>
                  <li>my smaller basement - two thirds of it was a semi-finished area - so even less storage space.</li>
                  <li>smaller garage - still a two car garage so room for our two cars but not as much open room for stuff.</li>
                  <li>no hall coat closet</li>
              </ul>
              <ul>
                  <li>But - we never filled up that huge empty basement.</li>
                  <li>Because the HOA takes care of the yard work and snow removal there will not be lawn care equipment to store in the garage.</li>
              </ul>

              <h2>And the downsize begins</h2>
              <p>
                  My first step was to go through the stuff in the basement.  Although we never came close to filling it with stuff we still did some extreme purging by selling on Facebook,
                  donating to GoodWill and a community rummage sale and throwing stuff in the recylcle and trash
              </p>
              <p>Interesting side note - you can throw away cans of paint if the paint is completely dryed.  The trick here is to dump cat litter in the can to absorb the paint and then let it dry.</p>
              <p>Next job - the garage.  We sold or gave away the lawn equipment and the snow blower.  I kept my tools and my small tool bench.  Everything that I couldn't see myself using again purged.</p>

              <p>So I figured that between the basement and the garage purges that I had adequately addressed the majority of my downsizing delimma.</p>

              <p>But every area in my house I reviewed with a sharp eye - </p>
              <ul>
                  <li>What was old and not really usable</li>
                  <li>What had we not used in the past year or two</li>
                  <li>Did I even like the thing?</li>
              </ul>
              <p>I used the approach on my kitchen cabinets, the bookshelf in the office, knick knacks around the house, even with the clothes in the closets.</p>
              <p>Did I want to bring stuff that I did not really care about to my new place?  NO WAY!</p>

              <h1>Stuff I will probably regret moving to the new place . . . &yen;&cent;&plusmn;&iquest;&part;</h1>
              <img src="images/regret.jpg" alt="regret sculpture" />

              <p>There still seems like a lot of stuff to move.  Most of it are things that my daughter wants someday.</p>
              <ul>
                  <li>Ugly green metal bread rack - going in the semi finished basement - AKA "The Girl Cave"</li>
                  <li>Bookcase headboard that my daughter has absolutely no plans on using but must keep</li>
                  <li>Metal halloween sculptures - I just cannot see trying to sell in Spril - I'll wait until September and get a better price.</li>
                  <li>
                      China cabinet - I don't really like it but I do like have a place to display all my fancy stuff.  I figure that if I continue to dislike it then
                      someday I will sell the china cabinet and buy something that I do like.
                      <br> UPDATE - I really like the china cabinet in the front foyer of the place - and I am glad I kept it.
